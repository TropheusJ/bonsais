Bonsai Pots can be used to grow miniature versions of any tree with a sapling.
Start by crafting one with some terracotta, bricks, and dirt.

Once crafted, place it down. Click it with any supported sapling (see below) and watch it grow!

### How does it work?
When planted in the pot, the sapling is simulated and actually grown. Each tree will
have variation as if it was planted on the ground normally.

### Current Features
The mod is currently an alpha version. It is not feature complete, and can only be
used for decoration right now. More features and functionality are planned.

### Supported Saplings
All vanilla-style saplings should work. This means (almost) all vanilla saplings as well
as most modded ones should work fine. However, a notable exception is the Dark Oak tree.
Since it requires a 2x2 of saplings, it can't be grown currently. Fixing this is planned.

Mushroom trees are not yet supported.
